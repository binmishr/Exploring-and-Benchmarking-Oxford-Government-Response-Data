A Brief Introduction
====================

Assessing the impact of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions on the spread of Covid-19 requires data on Governmental measures. Luckily, the Assessment Capacities Project (ACAPS) and the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker both provide such data. In this blog post, I explore the new data provided by the Oxford initiative and compare it against the data provided by ACAPS that is already included in my {tidycovid19} package that offers download handles and some visualization tools for Covid-19 related data.
